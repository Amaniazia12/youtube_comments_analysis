## Sentiment analysis on youtube comments

This is the notebook used to train the naive bayes model to do the sentiment analysis. It was trained using the imbd movie dataset.
<br/>
Our model achieved over 80% accuracy on the test set. Running this model will be accurate enough for our purposes because the model is run on multiple comments causing the error to decrease. This method is called bootstrap aggregating (bagging).

To run this model, download the imbd dataset (around 60 MBs) and save them as csv files using the names ("imbd_tr.csv" and "imbd_te.csv") in the same location as the notebook.
